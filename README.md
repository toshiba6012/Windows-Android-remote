# Windows-Android-remote
First you install qt scrcpy and mirror your phone. Then you run a Teamviewer or Remote Desktop and run the server on the Qt scrcpy window. Finally you use the 
Teamviewer remote or RDR viewer on Iphone or Android. The versatility is awesome. When I tested it only had one device it messed my computer. The need for this was because of my other repository Android 64bit DTS. I have to keep that phone plugged into my stereo so this is a remote for it. Download is available through my Onedrive file is too large to upload. Enjoy!



Best regards
